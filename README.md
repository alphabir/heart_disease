❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical attributes. The dataset includes patient health records, such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and other clinical features. The goal is to build a predictive system that can assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalization)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Implementation of multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Comparison of different models to find the best-performing one

Visualization of model performance
